* Use of the inspector to expose variables
* A random element(use of Math.fRandom or equivalent)

Documentation Requirements:
* How to play the game
* A link to the repository that is accessible to the assessor
* A statement on any assets or code that is not the work of the student
* A statement on AI usage
* A section that highlights how your submission meets each of the criteria listed above
* A discussion of the three most interesting parts of your time developing the game
o This could be an elegant solution to a task
o A complex bug that you fixed
o A feature that you made more efficient through optimisation
o A feature that is well executed within the game
o A lesson learned about game development
Included must be a critical evaluation of the project and your own work. You will discuss the successes of the work and where it can be improved. You will also discuss your own performance and lessons learned for any future work.

Submission:
* Build
o This folder should contain a working executable (.exe) version of your game. Test on lab machines.
* Project
o This folder should contain all of the project files necessary to open your game in the Unity Editor. Please delete the “Library” folder as it massively increases the size of the project and is not required.
* Documentation
o This folder should contain your supporting documentation in .dox (word) or .pdf (adobe) format.
* Video
o This folder should contain a short video (max 1 minute) that shows your executable working. It does not require any sort of narration.


Game ideas:
1. 2D shooter-platformer
2. 2D google dinosaur game inspired
3. 2D multiplayer game, inspired by “rooftop snipers”
